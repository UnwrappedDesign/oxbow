    answer:
      "End-to-end encryption is a method that ensures only the sender and the recipient of a message can access its content. When you send a message, it is encrypted on your device, making it unreadable by anyone else.",
  },
  {
    question: "Forgot my key?",
    answer:
      "If you forget your encryption key, your encrypted data becomes inaccessible. This is a deliberate security measure to ensure that your sensitive data remains protected, even if someone gains unauthorized access to your account. ",
