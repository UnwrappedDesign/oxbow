# License

Let’s cut the legal theater. Here’s the deal.

---

## Personal license

You bought a license. Congrats. That means **you** (not your buddy, not your team, not your Discord server) get to use OxbowUI forever.

**You can:**

- Build unlimited websites, apps, side projects, or client work.
- Edit, hack, and customize the components however you want.
- Use them in commercial projects, SaaS apps, or open source, no limits.

**You cannot:**

- Turn OxbowUI into your own UI kit, template pack, or component library.
- Build a website builder where other people assemble sites with our components.
- Share the components outside of an actual project.
- “Accidentally” upload our entire library to GitHub.
- Train your AI model on it. (Yes, we have to say that now.)

**Examples of allowed use:**

- Your personal site.
- A client’s website.
- A SaaS app people pay for.
- An open source app that just happens to use OxbowUI.

**Examples of not allowed use:**

- Repackaging components into a new UI kit.
- Selling templates made from OxbowUI.
- Making a Figma kit and giving it away.
- Shipping a “website builder” powered by OxbowUI.

## Team license

One license covers up to 10 people in your company (employees or contractors). Same freedoms as the Personal License, but now your whole team can use it.

**You can:**

- Build unlimited projects for yourself or your clients.
- Customize and ship as many end products as you want.
- Use OxbowUI in commercial or open source projects.

**You cannot:**

- Hand out access to people outside your company.
- Package OxbowUI as a product or feature for resale.
- Pretend your “course” or “membership” includes OxbowUI.
- Let team members use the license for their side hustles.
- Compete with OxbowUI. (Yes, that includes “totally original” component kits that look suspiciously familiar.)
- Train your AI on it. Again, stop asking.

## Other stuff you should know

- No attribution required. You don’t need to put our name anywhere.
- All photos and illustrations belong to their original owners. They’re demo fluff, not part of the license.
- We reserve the right to change styles, components, or blocks whenever we feel like it.
- Liability? If something breaks, the most you’re getting back is what you paid us.

## Legal

This agreement is governed by the laws of Mariehamn, Åland Islands (yes, that’s a real place). If you violate the license, we can revoke access, deny refunds, or take legal action. Hopefully it doesn’t come to that.
