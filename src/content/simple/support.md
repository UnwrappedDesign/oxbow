# Support

OxbowUI is a collection of Tailwind blocks. It’s not a custom dev shop, and it doesn’t come with round-the-clock support.

Here’s what you can expect from us:

- Help with account and licensing issues.
- Guidance on using what’s included.
- A friendly nudge in the right direction if you’re stuck.

Here’s what’s **not** included:

- Debugging your code or fixing layouts.
- Step-by-step lessons on HTML, CSS, or Tailwind.
- Ongoing “consulting” services.

If you’re just starting out with HTML or Tailwind, there are plenty of great tutorials and resources online to help you learn the fundamentals.

What we _do_ have is a small, helpful community where users sometimes ask questions, share tips, or vent about tricky problems. If that sounds good, feel free to email us and we’ll point you in the right direction.
