# Support

Let’s set expectations: OxbowUI is a pile of Tailwind blocks. It’s not your personal dev team, and it’s definitely not coming with 24/7 hand-holding.

Here’s the deal:

- We’ll help with account stuff and licensing.
- We will **not** debug your code, fix your layout, or explain how CSS works. If you need that, Google exists.
- If your problem is “I don’t know HTML or Tailwind,” that’s not a problem,... that’s a career choice.

What we _do_ have is a small community of users who occasionally ask questions, share answers, or just complain about things. Feel free to email us if you want in. Just don’t expect “consulting services.”
