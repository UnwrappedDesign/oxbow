# Support
Oxbow UI is designed for self-service use. Although we provide assistance for account management and licensing issues, users should already be familiar with HTML & Tailwind CSS to effectively utilize the product.

Given the unique nature of each project and the complexities involved in understanding how different pieces of code work together, we do not provide technical support or consulting services.

However, Oxbow UI users can join our private Discord community to ask questions and offer help to others. Please note, we do not provide direct technical support or consulting within this community.
