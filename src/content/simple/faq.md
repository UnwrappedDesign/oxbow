### What does life time access mean?
- Purchasing an all-access license is a single payment, with no ongoing subscription fees. With this license, you gain permanent access to all content on Oxbow UI.

### What does free updates mean?
When you buy an all-access license, you unlock every component currently offered, as well as any future additions, without extra charges.

### Do you create the design for the components?
Unfortunately, design assets for tools such as Figma or other design tools are not included in the components.

Since the primary focus is on developing high-quality components in code, we don't allocate resources to creating additional design assets.

### What frameworks are supported?
When the components are developed in code, we use Tailwind CSS and to those components that need JavaScript the components use Alpine.js.
