**General**

### What does lifetime access mean?

It means exactly what it says. Pay once, get it forever. No subscriptions, no “premium tiers,” no surprise invoices. We’re not Netflix.

### What does free updates mean?

Buy it once, and every future component magically shows up in your account. Free. No upsells. No “Pro plan.” Just updates.

### Do you create Figma or design files for the components?

Hell nah... this is code or markup depends on the fight side you are, not Dribbble. If you need fancy mockups to feel productive, open Figma and draw some rectangles yourself.

### What frameworks are supported?

Tailwind CSS and AlpineJS. That’s it. No bloated React wrappers, no “integration guides,” no 40, step configs. Copy. Paste. Done.

**License**  
Want the fine print? Read the boring version [here](/license).

### Do I need to buy a new license for every project?

No. Unlike most component sellers, we don’t nickel-and-dime you. Buy once, build unlimited projects. Wild concept, right?

### Can I use it for my clients?

Yes. Build whatever you want for your clients. The only rule: don’t use Oxbow UI to crank out resale templates. We sell components, not pyramid schemes.

### Can I use it for my personal projects?

Yes. All of them. As many as you want. Side projects, SaaS, or your “next big thing” that nobody uses. Go nuts.

### Can I use it in open source projects?

Yep. As long as you’re making a website and not repackaging Oxbow UI into yet another “open source UI kit,” we’re cool.

### Can I make and sell themes or templates with Oxbow UI?

No. Nice try. If your business plan is “resell someone else’s components,” that’s not entrepreneurship, that’s theft smarty pants.

### What about support?

Read the [support page](/support). Spoiler: don’t expect us to debug your code.
