# Getting Started

This isn’t a framework. It’s not ShadCN, it won’t change your life. It’s just simple Tailwind CSS blocks with a bit of Alpine. That’s the whole point.  

1. Install [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/). Still hand-writing CSS? Adorable.  
2. Add [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/). Interactivity without dragging in React and half of npm.  
3. Use [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/). There are 6000 of them, and they're free, what's not to love?
4. Done. No bloated configs. No docs. No GitHub-star begging. Just blocks.
