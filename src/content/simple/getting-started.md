# Getting Started

Let’s be clear: this isn’t a “framework,” it’s not “the future of UI,” and it definitely won’t change your life. It’s just clean Tailwind blocks, sometimes with a sprinkle of Alpine. And that’s exactly why it works.  

1. Install [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/). If you’re still writing vanilla CSS by hand, that’s adorable.  
2. Add [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/). The no-nonsense way to make stuff move without dragging in React and half of npm.  
3. Use [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/). Almost 7,000 of them. You’ll use four. Congratulations, you’re unique.  
4. Done. No bloated configs, no “before you begin” novel, no begging for GitHub stars. Just blocks that actually work.  

## Need Help?

If you can’t figure this out, close your laptop and pick a new hobby. But if you insist, email [oxbowui@gmail.com](mailto:oxbowui@gmail.com) or yell into the void on [Twitter](https://x.com/oxbowui). We may or may not care.
