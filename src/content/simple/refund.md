# Refund Policy

Here’s the deal: you’ve got 7 days. If you regret buying OxbowUI for any reason, buyer’s remorse, bad life choices, or you just don’t like Tailwind anymore, email [oxbowui@gmail.com](oxbowui@gmail.com). We’ll refund you. No forms. No begging. No “manager approval.”

After 7 days, the honeymoon’s over. You own it. No exceptions.

A few things to be crystal clear about:

- Refunds are for humans, not hustlers. If you buy it, clone it, and then ask for a refund… no.
- If you violate the license, forget about getting your money back.
- We don’t do partial refunds. It’s all or nothing.

So: 7 days, full refund, no drama. Past that? You keep it forever, just like that domain name you swore you’d use for your “next big project.”
