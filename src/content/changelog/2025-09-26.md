## Command Bars

We shipped a family of command bars with distinct use‑cases and consistent keyboard ergonomics (Cmd/Ctrl+K or `/` to open, `↑/↓` to navigate, `↵` to select, `Esc` to close). All variants include fuzzy search, a clear button, and dark‑mode friendly styles. Dynamic classes are protected in the safelist to survive obfuscation.

- 01 (Free, minimal): Quick actions for New Project, Templates, Docs, Help. Emits `cmd:choose`.
- 02 (Shortcuts + chords): “Recent” cards and “Commands”. Supports `W` then `I/T/C` and single keys.
- 03 (Issue triage): Tabs for All/Open/Mine/Mentions, priority chips. Actions emit `triage:action`.
- 04 (Automation runner): Configure, run, or schedule automations; favorites in localStorage.
- 05 (Universal search + preview): Results + right‑side preview, pinning, copy/open.

Quality of life

- Removed brittle ring overrides and added explicit dark‑mode borders where needed.
- Added safelist entries for dynamic tokens (`bg-white/5`, `text-accent-600`, etc.) and exported `excludeFromObfuscation` in each bar.

## Notifications

We introduced accessible, Alpine‑powered overlay notifications with a single permanent live region and focused use‑cases. All appear at sensible positions, support transitions, and avoid CSS obfuscation pitfalls.

- 01 (Global single, top‑right): Success/Info/Warning/Error. Hover pauses auto‑dismiss; close button. Trigger with:

```js
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent("notify", {
    detail: {
      type: "success",
      title: "Saved",
      message: "All good",
      timeout: 4000,
    },
  }),
);
```

- 02 (Update available, bottom‑center): Version badge, release notes toggle, “Reload now”, “Later”. Listens to the same `notify` event with `{ version, notes }`.

- 03 (Upload progress, bottom‑center): Progress with Pause/Resume/Cancel; on completion shows Open/Dismiss. Trigger with:

```js
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent("notify-upload", {
    detail: { name: "archive.zip", size: "80 MB", link: "/files/archive.zip" },
  }),
);
```

Accessibility and DX

- All notifications are placed in `aria-live` regions, use semantic roles, and expose screen‑reader labels for controls.
- Transition utility classes are added to the safelist and `excludeFromObfuscation` to keep them stable in production builds.

## Modals

We expanded the application modals with a flexible, Alpine‑powered date range picker and quality‑of‑life improvements across the set.

- 08 (Date range + time): Dual‑month calendars with ISO week numbers, hover preview, and presets.
  - Presets: Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30 days, This/Last Week, This/Last Month, This/Last Year, All time.
  - Options: Range toggle, “Disable weekends”, and month min/max constraints (quick “Limit to this month” helper).
  - Time: Start/End time inputs with Apply/Cancel/Clear actions.
  - Events: Emits `daterange:apply` with `{ start, end }` as Date objects.
- Accessibility: Uses `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, Escape to close, and overlay click dismissal.
- Theming: Polished light/dark contrast for selected and in‑range days; transition and dynamic classes are safelisted and exported via `excludeFromObfuscation`.
